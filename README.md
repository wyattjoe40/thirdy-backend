## Thirdy

[Thirdy](https://www.Thirdy.app) was a website I created as a 30-day challenge to learn React and NodeJS. The website allows users to participate in and track 30-day challenges (how meta!).

## Thirdy Backend

This repo is the backend portion of the Thirdy website. It is built using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The server runs in a container on Azure.
